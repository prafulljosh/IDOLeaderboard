# IDOLeaderboard
This project is a website for listing IDOs that allows users to view upcoming and active IDOs via a smart contract, vote for their favorite IDOs, and comment on them. The site includes a leaderboard that displays the IDOs with the most votes at the top. 

Deployment Instructions:

Clone the repository from Github and download the code to your local machine.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:


` npm install `

Replace the ABI and contract address in the JavaScript code with your own smart contract's ABI and address.

Deploy your smart contract to the mainnet using a tool such as Remix or Truffle.

Once your smart contract is deployed, update the ABI and contractAddress variables in the JavaScript code with the new values.

Deploy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to your web server or hosting provider, such as CPanel.

Make sure your web server or hosting provider supports your website's technologies, such as web3.js for interacting with the blockchain network.

Test your website to make sure everything is working as expected, such as retrieving IDO data from the smart contract, displaying the leaderboard, and allowing users to vote and comment on IDOs.

Congratulations, your website for listing IDOs with a leaderboard is now live on the mainnet
